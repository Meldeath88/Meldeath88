- 👋 Hi, I’m @Meldeath88
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, Python, SQL, and other technologies that will help me reach my career goals as a data analyst and/or developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pyhon 3.9, SQL, PowerBI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple projects that require next to no former experience or expertise, since my coding skills are low and I am only now branching into IT as a whole.
- 📫 You can reach me at my cell +48 690 223 822 or by email maciej.smigocki@gmail.com.

I am based in Bydgoszcz, Poland, with a linguistic background (I finished a Bachelor's Degree at Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz, but I have always been interested in computers, technology, and down the line, programming and creating my own applications and services.
